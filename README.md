# Weather-app
The weather app will be a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions of a specific location. It will consist of three main components: the input section, the weather display section, and the forecast section.

Input Section:
The input section will contain a text input field where users can enter the location they want to check the weather for.
Next to the text input field, there will be a button labeled "Get Weather" that users can click to fetch the weather data.
Weather Display Section:
The weather display section will show the current weather conditions for the entered location.
It will include elements such as the temperature, weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy), humidity, wind speed, and any additional information you want to display.
You can also include an icon or an image that represents the current weather condition.
Forecast Section:
The forecast section will display the weather forecast for the next few days.
It can include a simple table or a card-based layout to show the forecasted temperature and weather conditions for each day.
